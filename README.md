## About: 
Educational page teaching how to code in Python and how to use Pandas (Data Science Library). Part of @stat.mi on Instagram.

## Created by: 
Milan Butani and Saro Guregyan

## Setup:
Follow the .pdf file for all the setup instructions. After your computer is setup, you should be ready to use the files under the uploads. 

## Opening a file:
Download the file and relevant dataset used within the file. Connections between dataset (.csv) files and notebook files (.ipynb) will be made clear in commit messages. 

Once Jupyter Notebook is open, navigate to the .ipynb file. Be sure to keep all files in the same place on your computer or else the code will not run, as files will not be found.
