    "## Indexing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Before going into the other advanced data types, let's take a second to understand what **indexing** is. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Indexing** is useful to extract individual elements that are inside your advanced data type. \n",
    "- For example, indexing can help you find the first, second, ... ninth element in the list or array. \n",
    "\n",
    "To index into your array, you need to use the **bracket notation**. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bracket Notation: \n",
    "To extract an element from a list, simply type ```[]``` after typing in the variable the list is stored under. Inside the ```[]```, you need to put a number that is the location of the item you are looking for. \n",
    "- If you want the first item from your list, use the number 0. \n",
    "- If you want the second item from your list, use the number 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is how indexing works in Python. The index of an item will be the place of the item in the list **minus 1**. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if I want the third item in my ```the_first_five_ints``` array, I will write: ```the_first_five_ints[2]```"
